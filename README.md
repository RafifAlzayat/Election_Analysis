Election-Audit Summary: 

The code provided can be modified to be used by any other county or state. The only change is to use a different CSV file that is formatted in the same manner as the one used for this election.

The number of candidates and or counties can be more or less and code will still perform. 

If the script is to be used in a state election then the column “county” needs to be renamed to “state” in addition, the code output would be modified to reflect this change as well.
